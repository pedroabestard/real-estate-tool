# 🏠 Real Estate Research Tool

A **persistent, URL-powered RAG app** that helps you research real estate trends, mortgage rates, and market news without copy-pasting articles into ChatGPT.

## 🚀 Why use this instead of ChatGPT?

### 1. No more copy–paste fatigue
Manually pasting long articles into ChatGPT is tedious. With this app, just paste the **URLs** — the app will scrape, chunk, embed, and index the content for you.

### 2. No context window limits
LLMs have finite context windows, meaning they can’t read and reason over dozens of articles at once.  
Here, content is stored in a **vector database**, letting the model search the most relevant chunks no matter how big your knowledge base grows.

### 3. Persistent, aggregate knowledge base
Instead of losing context every time you start a new conversation, this app **builds an ongoing vector store** from all the URLs you feed it — allowing cumulative research across multiple articles and days.

## ⚙️ How it works

![Architecture Diagram](architecture.png)

1. **Input**: Paste 1–3 URLs in the sidebar (ideally real-estate related news).
2. **Processing**:  
   - Content scraped with `SeleniumURLLoader`.
   - Split into semantic chunks with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
   - Embedded using `Alibaba-NLP/gte-base-en-v1.5`.
   - Stored in a persistent `Chroma` vector database.
3. **Query**: Ask a question about the aggregated articles.
4. **Retrieval & Answering**:  
   - Relevant chunks retrieved from the vector store.
   - Answer generated by `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` via Groq.
   - Uses `RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain` to always show sources.
