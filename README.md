# üè† Real Estate Research Tool
[![Open on Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://real-estate-tool.streamlit.app/)

A **persistent, URL-powered RAG app** that helps you research real estate trends, mortgage rates, and market news without copy-pasting articles into ChatGPT.

## üöÄ Why use this instead of ChatGPT?

### 1. No more copy‚Äìpaste fatigue
Manually pasting long articles into ChatGPT is tedious. With this app, just paste the **URLs** ‚Äî the app will scrape, chunk, embed, and index the content for you.

### 2. No context window limits
LLMs have finite context windows, meaning they can‚Äôt read and reason over dozens of articles at once.  
Here, content is stored in a **vector database**, letting the model search the most relevant chunks no matter how big your knowledge base grows.

### 3. Persistent, aggregate knowledge base
Instead of losing context every time you start a new conversation, this app **builds an ongoing vector store** from all the URLs you feed it ‚Äî allowing cumulative research across multiple articles and days.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

1. **Input**: Paste 1‚Äì3 URLs in the sidebar (ideally real-estate related news).
2. **Processing**:  
   - Content scraped using **requests + BeautifulSoup** (replacing Selenium due to cloud compatibility issues).
   - Split into semantic chunks with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
   - Embedded using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
   - Stored in an `in-memory Chroma vector database` for Streamlit Cloud.
3. **Query**: Ask a question about the aggregated articles.
4. **Retrieval & Answering**:  
   - Relevant chunks retrieved from the vector store.
   - Answer generated by `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` via Groq.
   - Uses `RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain` to always show sources.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Lessons Learned

- **Selenium issues on Streamlit Cloud**: Initially, Selenium with ChromeDriver caused exit code 127 errors due to missing system libraries.
- **Access Denied on some sites**: Certain news websites blocked bot-like requests. Switching to requests with a browser-like User-Agent solved this.
- **Simplifying dependencies**: Removed heavy packages like unstructured and Selenium to make deployment lightweight and cloud-friendly.
